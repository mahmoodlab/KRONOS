**KRONOS** is a **panel-agnostic foundation model for spatial proteomics**, self-supervised on 47 million single-marker patches spanning 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, 8 imaging platforms and 5 institutions. Its architecture couples a *shared channel-wise stem* with *sinusoidal marker-identity embeddings*, making it natively compatible with high-dimensional multiplex data.

### Key Features
* üî¨ **Biology at scale:** label-efficient cell phenotyping, unsupervised tissue phenotyping, tissue/region classification, artefact detection, patient stratification, and spatial biomarker discovery.  
* üîé **Spatial search engine:** drop in any cell, patch, or region of interest and KRONOS retrieves morphologically or immunologically similar areas across multi-cohort databases‚Äîsupporting both exploratory and hypothesis-driven queries.  
* üõ†Ô∏è **Open resource:** pretrained weights and step-by-step notebooks/tutorials.

## üì¢ News

### June 2025

- Initial codebase up! KRONOS model weights are now available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/kronos).

## Requirements and Access

**Hardware requirements:** KRONOS can be run on any consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA 3090). 

**Software requirements:** KRONOS was developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Python 3.10.

**Model access:**  Request access to the KRONOS from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/kronos).

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Create a virtualenv
#### Using Anaconda
``` shell
conda create -n kronos python=3.10.0
conda activate kronos
```
#### Using Python
``` shell
# for Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv kronos
source kronos/bin/activate

# for Windows
py -m venv kronos
.\kronos\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 2. Install KRONOS
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.git && cd KRONOS
pip install -e .

# run this command to install packages required for running tutorials
pip install -e .[tutorials]
```


### Step 3. Load KRONOS with pretrained weights
```python
from kronos import create_model, create_model_from_pretrained
model, precision, embedding_dim = create_model_from_pretrained(
    checkpoint_path="hf_hub:MahmoodLab/kronos", # Make sure you have requested access on HuggingFace
    cache_dir="./model_assets",
)

print("Model precision: ", precision)
print("Model embedding dimension: ", embedding_dim)
```

### Step 4. Process a multiplex image

We provide an example of processing a batch of dummy multiplex images with 10 markers. Refer to the tutorials for full-scale examples. 

```python
import torch
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)

batch_size = 2
marker_count = 10
patch_size = 224

# generating a dummy batch with random values
batch = torch.randn(batch_size, marker_count, patch_size, patch_size).to(device)

# generating dummy mean and std values for normalization
# see marker_metadata.csv for actual mean and std values for each marker ids
mean = torch.randn(marker_count).to(device)
std = torch.randn(marker_count).to(device)

# normalizing the batch
batch = (batch - mean[None, :, None, None]) / std[None, :, None, None]

# feature extraction
with torch.no_grad():
    patch_embeddings, marker_embeddings, token_embeddings = model(batch)

print(f'Patch embeddings: {patch_embeddings.shape}')
print(f'Marker embeddings: {marker_embeddings.shape}')
print(f'Token embeddings: {token_embeddings.shape}')
```
You can now save the patch/marker/token-specific features to a npy or h5 file to use for downstream tasks.

### Why is Kronos called Kronos? 

In case you were wondering: No, KRONOS is not a nod to the [1954 alien-robots-from-space movie.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronos_(film)) We borrowed the name from the Kronosaurus, the Early Cretaceous marine reptile that could reach 10‚Äì11 meters in length. Fewer than a dozen reasonably complete Kronosaurus specimens have ever been excavated, and one of the best-known mounts hangs in the [Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/7/kronostory/). So yes, our model is literally named after a Harvard dinosaur. See more [here](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/7/kronostory/).
